cairo-gl-sdl2
=============

This project is a test bed for using Cairo, SDL2, and GL/GLES2 together.
It differs from existing projects in that it uses the new (ACTUAL) OpenGL
Cairo backend, which has recently received a lot of development attention.

I have found it to be almost twice as fast as the image backend, though
it can be up to triple the speed in some cases.
